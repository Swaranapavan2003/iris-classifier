Iris Flower Classification

Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

1.Objective:

This project demonstrates how to:
Load and explore the classic Iris dataset
Visualize the data
Preprocess and scale features
Train classifiers (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree)
Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

2.Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / scikit-learn

3.Features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Target: Flower species — Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

4.Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn

5.Models Used

Model                 	Description

Logistic Regression    Baseline linear model
K-Nearest Neighbors	   Instance-based non-parametric model
Decision               Tree	Tree-based classification model

6.Output Metrics
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

7.Results
